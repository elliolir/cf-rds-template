## Key concepts:

### VPC (Virtual Private Cloud): 
A VPC is a virtual network within AWS that allows you to logically isolate and control network resources. 
It acts as a private data center in the cloud. 
When creating an RDS instance and a Fargate application, you typically start by creating a VPC.

### CIDR Blocks: 
CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) blocks are used to define the IP address ranges within a VPC. 
A CIDR block specifies the base IP address and the number of significant bits in the network address. 
For example, a CIDR block of 10.0.0.0/16 represents a VPC with a range of IP addresses from 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.255.255.

### Subnets:
Subnets are subdivisions of a VPC that allow you to further segment and isolate your resources. 
In the context of VPCs, you typically have private and public subnets.

### Private Subnets:
Private subnets are not directly accessible from the internet. 
They are used for resources that do not need to be publicly accessible, such as databases. 
Private subnets have routing tables configured to route traffic to other subnets or resources within the VPC.

### Public Subnets:
Public subnets are accessible from the internet. 
They are used for resources that need to be publicly accessible, such as web servers. 
Public subnets have routing tables configured to route traffic to an internet gateway (IGW).

### Security Groups:
Security groups act as virtual firewalls for your resources within a VPC. 
They control inbound and outbound traffic at the instance level. When creating an RDS instance, you define a security group
that specifies the inbound and outbound traffic rules. For example, you can allow inbound traffic on port 5432 (PostgreSQL) 
only from specific IP addresses or security groups.

### Route Tables:
Route tables determine how network traffic is directed within a VPC. 
Each subnet is associated with a route table, which contains rules for routing traffic. 
For private subnets, the route table typically routes traffic to other subnets or internal resources within the VPC. 
For public subnets, the route table typically routes traffic to an internet gateway to enable internet connectivity.

### NAT Gateway
A NAT (Network Address Translation) Gateway is a managed AWS service that allows private subnets to communicate with the internet
while keeping the resources within the private subnet hidden from the public internet.
It acts as an intermediary between resources in the private subnet and the internet, translating their private IP addresses 
to a public IP address. NAT Gateway provides outbound internet access for resources in private subnets and helps facilitate 
scenarios such as downloading software updates, accessing external APIs, or sending logs to external services.

### Elastic IP (EIP):

An Elastic IP is a static public IPv4 address that can be allocated to your AWS resources, such as EC2 instances or NAT Gateways.
It provides a persistent public IP address that you can associate and disassociate with your resources.
EIPs are useful when you need a fixed public IP address that remains constant even if the associated resource is stopped or restarted.

Can be considered optional if you:
* don't need to have direct public access;
* have a load balancer with a static IP;
* can deal with a dynamic IP of your resources within the public subnet
